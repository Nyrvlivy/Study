### Subject Pronouns (or Nominative):
---
**Nominative case (Subject):** A subjective pronoun acts as a subject in a sentence.

Singular
> I (*Eu*)  
>  
> You (*Tu/Você*)
>  
> He/She/It (*Ele/Ela/Isso*)

Plural
> We (*Nós*)
>  
> You (*Vós/Vocês*)
>    
> They (*Eles/Elas*)

---
**Examples:**

`I` have a big chocolate bar.

`You` have some ice cream.

`She/He/It` has a cake.

`We` could have a party.

`You` all are invited to the party this weekend.

`They` could come, too.

---
### Objective Pronouns (or Accusative): 
---
**Oblique case (Object):** The objective case is used when something is being done to (or given to, etc.) someone.

Singular
> Me (*Me/Mim*)
> 
> You (*Lhe, o, a, te, ti, a você*)
> 
> Him/Her/It (*Lhe, a, a ele/ Lhe, a, a ela/Lhe, o, a*)

Plural
> Us (*Nos*)
> 
> You (*Vos, lhes, a vocês*)
> 
> Them (*Lhes, os, as*)

**Examples:**

Give the chocolate to `me`, please.

Why should I give it to `you`.

You could give it to `him/her/it` , instead.

Please share it with all of `us`.

Looking forward to seeing `you` all there

Do we have to share it with `them`?

### Possessive Pronouns (or Independent Possessive Pronouns):
---
**Possessive pronouns** are a type of possessive noun. Also, possessive pronouns simplify constructions that show possession of a noun by replacing it—in other words, independent possessive pronouns must stand alone and be used without a noun. 

Singular
> Mine (*Meu/Minha/Meus/Minhas*)
>
> Yours (*Teu/Tua/Teus/Tuas/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)
>
> His/Hers/Its (*Dele/Dela/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)

Plural
> Ours (*Nosso/Nossa/Nossos/Nossas*)
>
> Yours (*Vosso/Vossa/Vossos/Vossas/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)
>
> Theirs (*Deles/Delas*)

---
**Examples:**

That book is `mine`.

Is this pen `yours` or `his/hers`?

The cat licked its paws; that is `its` way of cleaning.

The house is `ours`, not `theirs`.

Is this umbrella `yours`?

Those toys are `theirs`.

---
### Possessive Pronouns vs Possessive Adjectives (or Possessive Determiners):
---

As their names imply, both *possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns show ownership*. However, unlike possessive pronouns—which **replace nouns—possessive adjectives go before nouns to modify them**.

Singular
> My (*Meu/Minha/Meus/Minhas*)
>
> Your (*Teu/Tua/Teus/Tuas/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)
>
> His/Her/Its (*Dele/Dela/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)

Plural
> Our (*Nosso/Nossa/Nossos/Nossas*)
>
> Your (*Vosso/Vossa/Vossos/Vossas/Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas*)
>
> Their (*Seu/Sua/Seus/Suas/Deles/Delas*)

---
**Examples:**

`My` plane is delayed.

`Your` dinner is ready.

I love `his/her` dog.

Remember not to judge a book by `its` cover.

The responsibility is `our` project.

I would have knocked on `their` door, but I heard `their` baby crying.
